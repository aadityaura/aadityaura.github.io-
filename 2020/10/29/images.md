GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, <br>and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br> As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, <br>even to the dull and the ignorant; <br>they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. <br>If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, <br>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br>Keep interested in your own career,<br> however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, <br>for the world is full of trickery. <br>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, <br>and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. <br>Especially do not feign affection. <br>Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, <br>it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, <br>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. <br>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. <br>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. <br>You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; <br>you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, <br>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. <br>And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. <br>With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, <br>it is still a beautiful world. <br>Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.
